# The Effect of Macroeconomic Indicators on Stock Market Performance

In this project, we decided to analyze the relationship between various macroeconomic factors during 1967 – 2022 and the performance of the S&P 500 stock market index in the United States. Our project aims to answer the question: “What is the relationship between the U.S. stock market and macroeconomic indicators for the United States?” 

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository. You may run the Rmd notebook files using R Studio. 

We use financial data from FRED, yFinance, and NASDAQ APIs. We provide the .py script to pull and export the datasets or you may use the .csv files in Final Data Source folder. Python requirements may be found in the requirements.txt file.

The project notebooks may be run without the aforementioned Python script by using the data sets uploaded in the repository. 

R requirements are included in their respective Rmarkdown files using require(); the Rmd files will install any packages that are not already pre-installed.

The final report and presentation was prepared collaboratively in Google Docs.
