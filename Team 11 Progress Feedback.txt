Progress Report and Video Feedback: Team 11
Parth Gada

Excellent presentation of the video and formatting of the report; complete with charts and visualizations. Very comprehensive; although I would have liked to seen some kind of initial results to see where you stood. Apart from that great work, good choice of varibales used; you are on the right track.

As always, if you would like to discuss anything further, feel free to ping/email me or schedule a meetting at pgada7@gatech.edu.
